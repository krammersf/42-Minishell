Words of Wisdom
Focus on the requirement 🎯


Please implement only what the subject explicitly requests. Anything that is not requested is not a requirement, and each additional implementation increases development time and adds unnecessary complexity to the project.
Perform extensive testing 🔬


This project has many points of attention that have arisen during development. All of these points have been included in the tests on this page. While not exhaustive, they provide a starting point for things that should work and things that should not. Check the tests
Study other shells 🔍


Our reference shell is Bash, but running certain commands in other shells may produce different results and help us better understand why certain things happen. Use Bash as a reference, but be open to examining the workings of other shells.
