# 42_Minishell
Shell implementation called Minishell
minishell

This is a shell implementation called Minishell. It is a command-line interpreter that provides a basic shell environment and supports various features such as command execution, input parsing, redirections, pipes, environment variables, built-in commands, and signal handling.

This project was developed in colaboration with teroVF.
Words of Wisdom
Focus on the requirement üéØ

Please implement only what the subject explicitly requests. Anything that is not requested is not a requirement, and each additional implementation increases development time and adds unnecessary complexity to the project.
Perform extensive testing üî¨

This project has many points of attention that have arisen during development. All of these points have been included in the tests on this page. While not exhaustive, they provide a starting point for things that should work and things that should not. Check the tests
Study other shells üîç

Our reference shell is Bash, but running certain commands in other shells may produce different results and help us better understand why certain things happen. Use Bash as a reference, but be open to examining the workings of other shells.
Features

    Prompt display: Minishell displays a prompt when waiting for a new command.
    Command history: It has a working history feature that allows navigating and reusing previous commands.
    Command execution: Minishell can search and launch the appropriate executable based on the PATH variable or using a relative or absolute path.
    Quoting: It handles single quotes ', preventing the interpretation of meta-characters within the quoted sequence. Double quotes " prevent the interpretation of meta-characters except for the dollar sign $.
    Redirections: Minishell supports input <, output > and append output >> redirections. It also handles here documents << where input is read until a line containing the specified delimiter.
    Pipes: It implements pipes | to connect the output of one command to the input of the next command in a pipeline.
    Environment variables: Minishell handles the expansion of environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) to their respective values.
    Special variables: It supports the special variable $? which expands to the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
    Signal handling: Minishell handles signals such as ctrl-C (SIGINT), ctrl-D (EOF), and ctrl-\ (SIGQUIT) according to the specified behavior in the subject.
    Built-in commands: It provides several built-in commands, including echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit, with their respective options and arguments.

Implementation Details

    The shell uses the readline library to provide line editing capabilities and command history.
    Input parsing is done using a combination of string manipulation and state tracking to handle quotes and command boundaries.
    Command execution is managed through a commands_manager function that handles the execution of commands, including pipe setup and file descriptor management.
    Built-in commands are implemented as separate functions and are executed within the shell process itself.
    Error handling and reporting are done through a combination of error codes, error messages, and signal handling.

Usage

To compile the Minishell program, use the provided Makefile by running make in the project directory. This will generate an executable named minishell.

make

To run the Minishell program, simply execute the generated minishell binary.

./minishell

Once running, you can enter commands and interact with the shell.
Requirements

    The Libft library is required and provided along with the project files.
    The program was developed and tested on a Unix-based system. Compatibility with other platforms may vary.

Limitations

    Minishell does not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters that are not required by the subject, such as backslashes \ or semicolons ;.
    The readline() function used in Minishell may cause memory leaks, but the code written specifically for this project should not have memory leaks.
